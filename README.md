This project is a collection of tools for use by my gaming group's D&D campaign.

The basic stack in use is:
* Azure SQL Server
* Azure App Service
* .NET Core
* React.js

This page follows the guidance and conventions from the [*Using ASP.NET Core to Build Single-page Applications* Pluralsight course](https://pluralsight.com/courses/aspnet-core-build-single-page-applications), so if you have Pluralsight access and are new to the technology stack being used here, that's a good starting point.
